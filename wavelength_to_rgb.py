    Color   Wavelength(nm) Frequency(THz)
    Red     620-750        484-400
    Orange  590-620        508-484
    Yellow  570-590        526-508
    Green   495-570        606-526
    Blue    450-495        668-606
    Violet  380-450        789-668

    f is frequency (cycles per second)
    l (lambda) is wavelength (meters per cycle)
    e is energy (Joules)
    h (Plank's constant) = 6.6260695729 x 10^-34 Joule*seconds
                         = 6.6260695729 x 10^-34 m^2*kg/seconds
    c = 299792458 meters per second
    f = c/l
    l = c/f
    e = h*f
    e = c*h/l

    List of peak frequency responses for each type of 
    photoreceptor cell in the human eye:
        S cone: 437 nm
        M cone: 533 nm
        L cone: 564 nm
        rod:    550 nm in bright daylight, 498 nm when dark adapted. 
                Rods adapt to low light conditions by becoming more sensitive.
                Peak frequency response shifts to 498 nm.

def wavelength_to_rgb(wavelength, gamma=0.8):

    '''This converts a given wavelength of light to an 
    approximate RGB color value. The wavelength must be given
    in nanometers in the range from 380 nm through 750 nm
    (789 THz through 400 THz).
